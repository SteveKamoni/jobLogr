## ✨ Why JobTrackr?

> “I missed an interview once because I forgot to follow up — that’s when I knew I needed a system. JobTrackr is for anyone tired of tracking their career in scattered notes or messy spreadsheets.”

Built by a developer who’s been there — and didn’t want others to make the same mistake.
